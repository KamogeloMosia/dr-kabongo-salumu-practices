# Dependency Conflict Resolution

## Issue
The project had a dependency conflict between `date-fns` and `react-day-picker`:
- `react-day-picker@8.10.1` requires `date-fns@^2.28.0 || ^3.0.0`
- The project was trying to use `date-fns@4.1.0`

## Solution
1. **Downgraded both packages to compatible versions:**
   - `date-fns`: `^2.30.0` (latest in v2 series)
   - `react-day-picker`: `^7.4.10` (compatible with date-fns v2)

2. **Added overrides and resolutions** to ensure consistent versions across the dependency tree

## Alternative Installation Commands

If you still encounter issues, try these commands:

### Option 1: Clean Install
\`\`\`bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
\`\`\`

### Option 2: Force Install (if needed)
\`\`\`bash
npm install --force
\`\`\`

### Option 3: Legacy Peer Deps
\`\`\`bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
\`\`\`

## Recommended Approach
Use the clean install (Option 1) first, as the package.json now has compatible versions.

## Version Compatibility Matrix

| react-day-picker | date-fns | Status |
|------------------|----------|---------|
| 7.4.10 | 2.30.0 | ✅ Compatible |
| 8.10.1 | 2.30.0 | ✅ Compatible |
| 8.10.1 | 4.1.0 | ❌ Incompatible |

## Notes
- `react-day-picker` v7 is stable and well-tested
- `date-fns` v2.30.0 is the latest in the v2 series
- These versions are widely used and have good community support
